\chapter{Uncertainty Applications}
\section{Monte-Carlo Dropout on MNIST}

\paragraph*{1.1. What can you say about the images themselfs? How do the histograms along them helps to explain failure cases? Finally, how do probabilities distribution of random images compare to the previous top uncertain images?}

\section{Failure prediction}

\paragraph*{2.1. Compare the precision-recall curves of each method along with their AUPR values. Why did we use AUPR metric instead of standard AUROC?}


\section{Out-of-distribution detection}

\paragraph*{3.1. Compare the precision-recall curves of each OOD method along with their AUPR values. Which method perform best and why?}
