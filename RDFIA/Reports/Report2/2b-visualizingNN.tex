\chapter{Visualizing Neural Networks}

\section{Saliency Map}
\paragraph*{$ \bigstar $ Show and interpret the obtained results.}
\paragraph*{Discuss the limits of this technique of visualization the impact of different pixels.}
\paragraph*{Can this technique be used for a different purpose than interpreting the network ?}
\paragraph*{\textbf{Bonus:} Test with a diffrentent network, for example VGG16, and comment.}



\section{Adversarial Example}
\paragraph*{$ \bigstar $ Show and interpret the obtained results.}
\paragraph*{In practice, what consequences can this method have when using convolutional neural networks?}
\paragraph*{\textbf{Bonus:} Discuss the limits of this naive way to construct adversarial images. Can you propose some alternative or modiÔ¨Åed ways? (You can base these on recent research)}


\section{Class Visualization}
\paragraph*{$ \bigstar $ Show and interpret the obtained results.}
\paragraph*{Try to vary the number of iterations and the learning rate as well as the regularization weight.}
\paragraph*{Try to use an image from ImageNet as the source image instead of a random image (parameter init_img). You can use the real class as the target class. Comment on the interest of doing this.}
\paragraph*{\textbf{Bonus:} Test with another network, VGG16, for example, and comment on the results.}
