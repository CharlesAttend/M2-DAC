# What makes a good decisions
* Simply : Identify, compare, choose options
* Less simply : The 10 'cardinal decision issue' outlined by Yates and Potworowski

---

* Options : Help to identify options, as well as help to narrow down the list of feasible or realistic options
* Possibilities : Help to to identify possible outcomes for each of the identified options
* Judgement : Help to judge which outcomes are most likely
* Value : Help to identify the positive and negative impacts on stakeholders for each of the identified options
* Trade-offs : Help to make trade-offs on the above criteria for each options
* Understandable : Help to understand how and why the tools works as it does, and when it fails

## Cognitive processes for decision making : Abductive reasoning

## Explainable AI and decision making : Over-reliance
* Over-realiance : Automation bias
* Participants who do seem to believe that they understand explanatory information, leading to over-confidence, even when presented with explanations that contain no useful information. 
* => Not enought cognitive engagement with the system 
* => Cognitive forcing : 
    * Eg. forcing people to give a decision before seeing a recommendation
    * slightly mitigated overreliance, but not enought to lead to a statistically significant differences
    * Least prefered method by participant : people not wanting to exert mental energy
<!-- This indicates that Evaluative AI could prove useful by not fixating people on particular recommendations, but allowing peo- ple to assess whether evidence supports their hypotheses, rather than trying to understand the DA’s reasoning. -->

# (Explanable) AI as Decision Support
## Giving recommendations with no explanatory information
* Joue seulement sur la confiance en notre décision finale, de manière binaire : si je suis d'accord j'ai plus confianc , si je ne suis pas d'accord je reréfléchis à ma décision 
* Mais ne coche aucune des cases du tableau 2
